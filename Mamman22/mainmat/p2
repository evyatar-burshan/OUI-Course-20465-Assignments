This is a pocket calculator that works on 6 matrices: MAT_A, MAT_B, MAT_C, MAT_D, MAT_E, MAT_F.
Please enter one of the following commands. Commands are to be spelled in small letters, matrices names in capital letters  and arguments are seperated by commass. Ex: trans_mat MAT_A, MAT_B.
Commands:
	1. read_mat MAT, up to 16 arguments(numbers)
	2. print_mat MAT
	3. add_mat MAT1, MAT2, MAT DESTINATION
	4. sub_mat MAT1, MAT2, MAT DESTINATION
	5. mul_mat MAT1, MAT2, MAT DESTINATION
	6. mul_scalar MAT1, scale(number), MAT DESTINATION
	7. trans_mat MAT, MAT DESTINATION
	8. stop
